## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science
I'm working on my C/C++ skills at the moment 
I love anything that interlaces finance and technology and aspire to be a quantitative trader (hence the username!)
I am also very interested in AI especially Machine Learning and computer vision related projects and would love to collaborate on these
